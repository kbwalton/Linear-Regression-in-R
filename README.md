# Linear-Regression-in-R
# Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Linear Regression Model in R to predict miles per gallon (MPG) based on horsepower using the built-in `mtcars` dataset. The software includes data loading, visualization, model fitting, statistical analysis, and prediction generation. 

The purpose of this project is to strengthen my understanding of regression modeling, data visualization, and statistical analysis in R. Additionally, I aimed to practice working with different R datatypes, loops, and functions, making the code modular and reusable.

# Development Environment

- **IDE**: RStudio  
- **Programming Language**: R  
- **Libraries Used**:  
  - `ggplot2` for data visualization  
  - `stats` (built-in) for regression analysis  

# Useful Websites

- [R Documentation](https://www.r-project.org/)  
- [ggplot2 Guide](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)  
- [Linear Regression in R](https://rpubs.com/)  

# Future Work

- Add functionality to import and export data using CSV files.  
- Implement inter-process messaging for parallel execution.  
- Enhance data visualization with interactive elements using `plotly`.  
- Extend the model to include multiple regression with additional predictors.
